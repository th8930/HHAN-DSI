# Graph Representation Learning for Side Effect Predictions

This repository contains a graph representation learning model for predicting side effects of drugs based on multimodal interactions among different molecule types. The model is implemented using Python and PyTorch, and it uses a graph convolutional neural network (GCN) to learn embeddings for each molecule in the dataset.

## Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by the work of Zitnik et al. (2018) on predicting drug side effects using graph convolutional networks. The implementation in this repository is based on the PyTorch Geometric library.
